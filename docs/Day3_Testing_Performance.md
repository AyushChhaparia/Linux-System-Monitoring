Day 3 - Database Testing & Performance Optimization
Overview
Step 4: Update Documentation

Member 5 is responsible for ensuring the reliability, performance, and scalability of the database.

Testing Coverage
Database Tests
Functional Tests: Verify all CRUD operations work correctly

Data Integrity Tests: Ensure data consistency and validation

Performance Tests: Measure query performance and optimization

Concurrency Tests: Test concurrent access and race conditions

Load Testing
API Load Tests: 50+ concurrent requests across all endpoints

WebSocket Load Tests: 20+ concurrent WebSocket connections

Database Load Tests: Concurrent read/write operations

Memory Usage Tests: Monitor memory leaks and resource usage

Performance Monitoring
Metrics Tracked
Function execution times

Database query performance

Memory usage patterns

CPU utilization

WebSocket connection handling

Optimization Techniques
Query plan analysis

Index optimization

Database vacuum and analyze

Connection pooling recommendations

Running Tests
bash
# Run all database tests
python -m unittest tests.test_database

# Run load tests (requires running application)
python -m unittest tests.test_load

# Run performance monitoring
python utils/performance_monitor.py

# Check database statistics
python -c "from database.models import db_manager; print(db_manager.get_database_stats())"

# Monitor application performance
python -c "from utils.performance_monitor import performance_monitor; print(performance_monitor.get_performance_summary())"
Performance Benchmarks
Target Metrics:

API response time: < 2 seconds average

Database query time: < 0.1 seconds for simple queries

WebSocket connections: 20+ concurrent

Success rate: > 95% under load
